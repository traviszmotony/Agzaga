<ul class="volume-price-ranges">
  <li>
    All ranges need to be expressed as Strings and can include or exclude parentheses. "(1..10)" and "1..10" are considered to be a valid range.
  </li>

  <li>
    If the range is defined with '..' then it also includes the upper end of the range.
  </li>

  <li>
    If the range is defined with '...' then the upper end of the range is not inclusive.
  </li>

  <li>
    Ranges can also be defined as "open ended." Open ended ranges are defined with an integer followed by a '+' character and should be defined at the last.
  </li>
